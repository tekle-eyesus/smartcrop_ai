**SmartCrop AI** is an intelligent mobile application that empowers smallholder farmers with AI-driven crop disease detection and expert farming recommendations. It leverages image recognition and machine learning to identify diseases in several crops, and provides practical mitigation guidance tailored to each case even in offline environments.

## App Overview

In many farming communities, timely identification and management of crop diseases is a major challenge. While existing tools exist, they are often expensive, require constant internet access, or are not user-friendly. **SmartCrop AI** fills this gap with a lightweight, offline-first assistant that combines:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for accurate image classification.
- **On-device TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** inference for performance and privacy.
- **Gemini-powered assistant** for personalized, AI-generated advice.
- **Rich resource support** like videos, markdown tips, and localized explanations.

## ⚡Features

- **Image-Based Disease Detection**  
  Capture or select a crop image to detect diseases instantly using trained CNN models.

- **Multi-Crop Support**  
  Currently supports **tomato**, **potato**, and **mango** crops each with its own tailored model and metadata.

- **AI-Powered Assistance**  
  Integrated NLP assistant that understands crop-specific questions and provides contextual replies.

- **Offline Functionality**  
  All detection is handled locally on-device with TFLite — no internet required after initial setup.

- **Expert Recommendations**  
  Displays disease-specific mitigation steps, video links, and AI-generated expert advice.

- **Local Result Storage**  
  Save and review previous detections directly from the app’s local storage.
